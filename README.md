# JavaScript Project Euler Exercises

I'm trying to use breaks and spare time in my day to go through the Project
Euler exercises with JavaScript. Mainly for kicks.

My goal is to reuse code when possible through a utility library with robust
test cases and 100% code coverage.

`setup.sh` has pseudo-shell-script for getting up and running.

`coverage.sh` displays code coverage information for the exercises.

`test.sh` executes test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the exercises.
