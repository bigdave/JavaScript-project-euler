# JavaScript Project Euler Exercises

I'm trying to use breaks and spare time in my day to go through the Project
Euler exercises with JavaScript. Mainly for kicks.

`setup.sh` has pseudo-shell-script for getting up and running.

`coverage.sh` displays code coverage information for the exercises.

`test.sh` executes test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the exercises.
